# Liminality

The threshold between two forms

## Requirements

Currently only written on Lispworks 8, this uses Lispworks libraries to run, so at least Lispworks Personal Edition is required.

Usage instructions also assumes quicklisp.

## Usage

Pull this repository to your quicklisp/local-projects directory. Then run the following to get started:

``` common-lisp
(ql:quickload :liminality)
(in-package :liminality)
(main)
(load-level "level-one")
```
